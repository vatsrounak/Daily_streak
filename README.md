# Daily_Streak
- This is a repo to where you maintain a daily streak on gitHub. This repo is intended for keeping raw code, codes  for   problems that you solve, or any other code that you think is helpful in your programming journey.

- So basically you need to write code everyday, and not just any code a meaningful code, so that this becomes a habit. So that's the intent of creating and maintaining this repo.
